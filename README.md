# Nice to meet you, I'm Kevin 👋

### 🚀 Currently working on
- Sharpening **data preprocessing, cleaning & wrangling** skills — from feature engineering & selection to model evaluation & tuning  
- Expanding into **Tableau** & **Power BI** for data visualization  
- Improving **SQL** for querying & analytics  
- Writing **cleaner, more modular Python code** for maintainable projects  

### 🤝 Looking to collaborate on
- **Open-source projects** that make data professionals’ work easier (Python packages, analysis templates, utility scripts)  
- **Insights-driven case studies** in product, marketing, or customer behavior analysis  
- Small but impactful tools that bridge the gap between raw data & actionable insight  

### 📚 Currently learning
- **Advanced data preparation** techniques for ML & statistical analysis  
- **Feature engineering & model tuning** best practices  
- **Interactive dashboards** in Tableau & Power BI  
- Deepening **SQL** & Excel proficiency  

### 💬 Ask me about
- Turning raw datasets into **business-ready insights**  
- Blending **machine learning with classic analytics**  
- Structuring analysis workflows for **clarity & reproducibility**  
- Why **asking the right question** matters more than the first line of code  

### ⚡ Fun fact
- I’ve taught **500+ cycling classes** — yes, I can shout motivation *and* explain logistic regression if needed  
- My playlists for **coding sessions** are suspiciously similar to my high-energy workout playlists  
- I believe **clear communication** is as important as model accuracy
